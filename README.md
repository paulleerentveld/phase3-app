# phase3-news-app
This is a basic CLI app that grabs data from the Newsapi.org website and lists out the latest news for Australia. You can choice an article to view the details and then save the article
to the local database. With the local data you can view a list of saved articles and search by name which is a wildcard search on the artile titles. 

# install instruction
Fork the repo and clone to your local directory. Run the rake db:migrate to setup the local database and then run bin/run to run the CLI.
